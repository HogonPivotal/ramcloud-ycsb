This repository contains the YCSB benchmark, plus additional code for
running it with RAMCloud. To run one or more YCSB benchmarks, do the following:

* Make a RAMCloud install directory visible at "ramcloud". RAMCloud itself
  is not included in this repository, so you must clone a RAMCloud repository
  someplace else and build it. Once you've done that, then run "make install"
  in the RAMCloud directory and create a symbolic from "ramcloud" in this
  directory to the RAMCloud ddirectory where you ran "make install".
  Alternatively, you can run "make install INSTALL_DIR=xxx" in the RAMCloud
  directory, where "xxx" refers to "ramcloud" in this directory.
* Run "make" in this directory to compile YCSB and additional supporting
  code.
* Edit the file "runYcsb" and modify the configuration options near the top
  of that file to specify the experiments you want to run. The RAMCloud
  server configuration is currently hardwired into that file, so you may
  have to modify that as well, if you aren't using the expected configuration.
* Invoke runYcsb from your command-line. Log files and other information
  will be stored in the "logs" subdirectory.
